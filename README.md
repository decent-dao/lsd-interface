# Liquid Streaming Derivatives 
 _Providing liquidity for future token holders_

LSD is an open-source protocol to create non-custodial liquidity markets for vested tokens. Users can participate as Streamers, Recipients or Liquidity Providers. Streamers are token projects who add their token contracts to the protocol to create derivative tokens for their vested tokens. These derivative tokens help act as a protective barrier against potential price crashes, essentially forming a price dump moat around the project tokens. They also allow the token investors, who are the Recipients of these derivative tokens, exchange their vested tokens at a discount in order to receive liquidity for those allocations right away. Liquidity Providers acquire the vested token contracts at a discount in exchange for providing liquidity to the market.
